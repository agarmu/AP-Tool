# AP-Tool

This is a simple java tool designed by Mukul Agarwal to make running
AP-Computer-Science A examples easier. All code is licensed under the GNU
General Public License Version 3.

## Building

To build AP-Tool, you need a Java Compiler and runtime. (Tested on OpenJDK 14)

You also need GNU Make to automate build tools and programs. In order to build a
complete JAR, just use the command below:

```console
$ make jar

javac ...
jar ...
```

*Note: your output should look similar, just replace the ... with other output.*

Voilà! You now have an ap.jar file!
